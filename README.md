# Expo Hackathon Camera App

A simple app we are going to build together using Expo and React Native!
This is a demo application where we will create during an interactive session for https://hacksv.faith/

Check out the [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1R2i_XBzimKFMwXoHg1Mnszus-xblqUOle-y-u_KiPoA/edit#slide=id.p) for how we will do it.

Be sure to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed and a nice edito like [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
